# Analyze-the-sentiment-of-reviews-with-Keras
In this module, we'll use Keras to build a neural network that scores text for sentiment. An input such as "Great service, and some of the best food I've ever tasted" will score close to 1.0 indicating the sentiment is positive, while an input such as "The food was bad and the service was terrible" will score closer to 0.0. Such systems are widely used today to monitor Twitter, Yelp, and other social-media services for sentiment regarding businesses and political candidates. To minimize setup and configuration, I've used Keras in a Jupyter notebook hosted in Azure Notebooks, where Keras, TensorFlow, and other libraries that I need are preinstalled.
